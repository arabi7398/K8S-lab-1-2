2-Create a pod with the name redis and with the image redis
--> kubectl run redis --image=redis
3- Create a pod with the name nginx and with the image “nginx123”
Use a pod-definition YAML file.
--> kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml
4- What is the nginx pod status?
--> ErrImagePull
5- Change the nginx pod image to “nginx” check the status again
--> vi nginx.yaml
--> kubectl get pods --> ngnix running
6- How many ReplicaSets exist on the system?
--> kubectl get replicasets --> zero
7- create a ReplicaSet with
name= replica-set-1
image= busybox
replicas= 3
--> created replicaset.yaml
--> kubectl apply -f replicaset.yaml
--> kubectl get replicasets
8- Scale the ReplicaSet replica-set-1 to 5 PODs.
--> kubectl scale replicaset replica-set-1 --replicas=5
9- How many PODs are READY in the replica-set-1?
--> kubectl get replicaset --> 5
10- Delete any one of the 5 PODs then check How many PODs exist now?
--> kubectl delete pods repica-set-1-chcqh --> 5
Why are there still 5 PODs, even after you deleted one?
-->  ReplicaSets act as controllers ensuring a desired number of replicas are running. When you delete a pod, the ReplicaSet controller detects the missing replica and launches a new pod to reach the target number
11- How many Deployments and ReplicaSets exist on the system?
12- create a Deployment with
name= deployment-1
image= busybox
replicas= 3
13- How many Deployments and ReplicaSets exist on the system now?
14- How many pods are ready with the deployment-1?
15- Update deployment-1 image to nginx then check the ready pods again
16- Run kubectl describe deployment deployment-1 and check events
What is the deployment strategy used to upgrade the deployment-1?
17- Rollback the deployment-1
What is the used image with the deployment-1?
18- Create a deployment using nginx image with latest tag only and remember to
mention tag i.e nginx:latest and name it as nginx-deployment. App labels should be
app: nginx-app and type: front-end. The container should be named as
nginx-container; also make sure replica counts are 3
